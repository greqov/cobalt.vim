For some reason, I'm never able to get a better cobalt theme for vim
than by using coloration to convert the actual TextMate theme over to
vim format.

And (because it's shared on github) we can collaborate to make it even
nicer looking over time.

## Installation ##

Either copy `cobalt.vim` to your `~/.vim/colors` directory manually,
or if you're using Janus, you can add this to your `~/.janus.rake`:

    vim_plugin_task "cobalt.vim", "git://github.com/sfsekaran/cobalt.vim.git"

For the latest version of Janus, simply git clone cobalt.vim into your ~/.janus folder.
